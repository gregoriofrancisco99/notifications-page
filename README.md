## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

With this project I put my JavaScrips knownlodge on test. I needed a solution for that would read the data inside my Objects and chance it's value (for the **Note: "Mark all read"** functionality) and I ended up with the following code:
...
```js	
Object.entries(document.getElementsByClassName('row')).forEach(row => {
    row[1]
    .classList
    .remove('unread')
  });
```
...


### Continued development

For my future projects, I want to be able to use ReactJS

### Useful resources

- [Convert an Object to an Array in JavaScript](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/object/convert-an-object-to-an-array-in-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped get unstucked in a crucial moment of my code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
